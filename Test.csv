The restaurant offers a fixed-price set menu with offerings from various countries across the globe and a special emphasis on barbecued food.
The Chain currently owns and operates 14 outlets across 10 major cities in India, and aspires to expand to over 100 outlets in next 2 years.
The overwhelming response to the outlets from the target clientele has encouraged the Company to open multiple outlets in Tier I cities with 3 units in Bangalore. The chain has further plans to open multiple outlets in cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Pune.
Barbeque Nation has a strong presence in Northern India with outlets at Gurgaon, Chandigarh, Lucknow and Jaipur and expansion plans directed towards the cities of Amritsar, Jalandhar, Noida and Kanpur. In Southern India, the group intends to go to Tier II cities, which include Visakhapatnam, Mysore, Cochin, and Coimbatore. The group intends to take the concept overseas soon with trade enquires being explored for England, the Middle East and Australia.
All Barbeque Nation outlets are designed on the lines of a European country home, offering a warm and friendly ambience. The restaurant offers an interesting concept wherein the guest can finish the skewers by marinating the barbeques with their preferred marinades, and finishing them as per their individual tastes.
The Company’s mission is to delight the guests and consistently deliver a great dining experience that is value for money, in a relaxing ambience coupled with attentive services. The target customer segment is not restricted to the high class but can even go to the middle class and is priced accordingly.
Sayaji Hotels Limited is a fast growing and entrepreneurial hospitality services group based out of Indore. The group has ambitious growth plans for its business that are centered on hotels and restaurants. The Group currently operates three hotels in Indore and Vadodara.
Sayaji Indore, the flagship property, features 210 rooms, clubhouse facilities and extensive banqueting and dining operations in addition to a bowling alley. The hotel would be expanded by an additional 200 rooms by 2010.
Sayaji Vadodara is the Group’s second property featuring 53 rooms. A third hotel, at Pune is expected to be completed by the end of 2008 and would comprise of 247 rooms. The Company is also creating business hotels with the first being a 204 key hotel at Indore.

BACK-GROUND:

Max Life Insurance started the Business Intelligence and Analytics journey in 2011 to a) Embed predictive intelligence in functional processes 
b) Raise the bar in strategic decision making through data-driven decisions
c) Enable sharper performance management through cutting edge dashboards

The unit has rapidly grown over the last 3.5 years, and now provides its services to all strategic areas of business: marketing analytics (cross-sell / up sell, customer lifetime value, etc), sales analytics, operations analytics (customer retention, customer surrenders, call centre optimization, etc), UW and Claims analytics, among others. 

Role and Expectations:

The roles requires the person to play a pivotal role in growing the unit and realizing its vision to become the central nervous system of the company for data driven decision making.

The role encompasses the following areas of work:
• Marketing Analytics: 
o Drive SOW revenues through Cross-sell & Upsell analytics
o Work with BU team to design and implement entire cross-sell campaigns and ensure close-looping of feedback/response through an LMS system
o Performance the required predictive/descriptive analytics to arrive at the right target audeince

• Digital Analytics: 
o Help in making inroads in the Digital Analytics space for the organization

Overall, we are looking for people who enjoy playing with large sets of data and are excited about solving real-life business problems. They understand that true value is generated by solving these business issues – whether through the descriptive or predictive route.
Attitudinally, we need those who believe in challenging the status quo, rather than following. They are go-getters and thus have very high levels on energy. Thus, they bring new ideas to the table. Moreover, they like to work with people and know how to get the work done through others. Thus, selling analytics to internal customers (CXOs) and showcasing its value will also form a significant part of their KRAs.

Form a statistical perspective, the incumbent should be well-aware with generally used modelling techniques such as Logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, association techniques, etc. The person should be able to guide the team on which statistical methodology should be used for a business problem and what are the pros and cons of each..

From a technical perspective, the incumbent should be well-versed with SAS. Moreover, a very good understanding of SAS architecture and how it works would be an advantage.

So, we are looking for:
-         Folks, who are from premier B Schools (like IIMs, ISB, XLRI), have spent 6-8 years in consulting to solve real world problems
-         Else, those who are from premier graduate schools (IITs, SRCC, etc) and have 9-11 years of work ex. 
-         Those who have been in strategy consulting or analytics consulting space or in Captive Centres for Analytics delivery in India
-         Those who now want to specialize in Insurance Analytics, and want to work very closely with CXO level executives to solve real world business solutions.
-         However, this role will NOT suite those who want to specialize in predictive modelling and want to build deep expertise in modelling/machine learning techniques
