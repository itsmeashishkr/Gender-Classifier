png,"Sales and Marketing Representative - Work From Home - Business to Consumer
We are a ""Work From Home Business Opportunity"" with absolutely No Investment, No Buying and Selling Products, No stocking inventory, etc... Get paid every time a person eats, drinks, bathes, cleans the house, does laundry, etc. They simply switch stores to North America's largest 30+ year old Online Wellness Shopping Club. You educate them, set up their shopping account and get paid. This is NOT one of those Multi-Level Marketing business opportunities.
We are experiencing tremendous growth due to the fact that more and more people are becoming aware of the importance of switching to safer consumer products. Revenues grew in 2016 by almost a Billion dollars over the previous year. There are currently 50,000 - 100,000 orders being placed daily.
Consumer product essentials are a Multi Billion Dollar industry. Products sold on local store shelves have about a 65% markup. We eliminate the ""middleman"" by helping consumers obtain their essentials direct from the manufacturer. Currently over 96% of those who shopped with us last month are shopping again this month, and that creates a true lifelong residual income because you get paid every time the person who you set up the account for shops. Commissions for all new accounts start at 50% for 3 months and then continue at 20% for those with 20 or more active shoppers. There are many perks, such as trips, products, pay bonuses, car bonuses and more. The details are explained during a scheduled 30 minute interview / overview. You also receive a free license to operate within the country of Canada, United Sates and Mexico. A $75 license is available for those wishing to do business in the other 15 countries we are currently operating in.
Checks are issued on the 16th of each month. A direct deposit option on the 12th of each month is available after 7 accounts are set up.
If you join our team, you tap into decades of experience with those who have successfully operated an at home business. You receive free training, a free URL Landing Page for marketing, and more; all to ensure you too experience success.
We are often asked, ""Is this a 'commission only' type job?"" The usual intent behind the question is, ""is there a base salary?"" The truthful answer is, ""this is much better"". A true ""residual income"" is one that steadily grows as you work from month to month. This is obviously much better than being locked into a ""salary"". The average income for those working only 5 - 10 hours per week is $500 - $2,500 per month. This is a real business that pays very well for those willing to work.
We are looking for LEADERS who are not easily discouraged by those who do not see the value of what is offered. The position requires discipline and endurance. If you have what it takes, are willing to follow the proven steps to success with our system, you will be thrilled to have partnered with us. We are now the #1 work from home business opportunity in North America.
Candidate must adhere to set standards and procedures and also willing to work a minimum of 5 Hours per week.

National Trust,"Use your Project Management co-ordination skills expertise at the National Trust - this three year fixed term role will be based in the Newcastle hub of the North Region but working at Seaton Delaval Hall on their exciting Heritage Lottery funded project.
Do you feel motivated by a role that is varied and diverse? Are you a confident, approachable, self-starter who is confident with finances and a brilliant organiser? Can you be part of a team which is working together to deliver outstanding building conservation and investment projects? Do you love the idea of working as part of a top-class team of conservation professionals? If so, this role could be for you.
What it's like to work here
Seaton Delaval Hall (SDH) is a Grade I listed building of outstanding significance that sits within a Grade II* registered park and garden. It is arguably one of the best surviving works of architect Sir John Vanbrugh, who was commissioned to create it in 1718. Although it was damaged by fire in 1822 and has significant conservation needs, it remains true to his original vision, with no major alterations overlying or obscuring his design for the Hall or its associated designed landscape.

Vanbrugh built SDH for Admiral George Delaval, MP, industrialist and naval hero. It became home to the larger than life Delaval family, known as the ‘Gay Delavals’ due to their high spirited and flamboyant lifestyle. The family loved a performance and an invitation to one of their parties was the hottest ticket in town. In an age notorious for extremes of behaviour, they stood apart as the most notorious of all Georgian partygoers and pranksters. This lies at the heart of SDH’s Spirit of Place that will guide all that we do and shapes our future; but first we have to ensure the stage is properly set.
2018-2021 is when we will set the stage and see the Curtain Rising at SDH as we embark on a £7.4m HLF funded programme. We will undertake conservation works to the building and landscape, bring the property to life for visitors with ambitious programming and interpretation, work closely with our local community and Northumbria University, while developing our own staff and volunteers on this exciting transformation of the property. SDH will remain open to visitors throughout, creating opportunities to connect people with our cause and enabling them to see vital conservation work in action.
What you'll be doing
The Senior Project Co-ordinator will work with the Project Manager to deliver the major Capital and Infrastructure works at SDH, as well as an exciting ‘people’ project working with partners, staff and volunteers, and the local community. The focus of this post is to provide project support expertise – co-ordinating project team members, reviewing and preparing financial information, preparing reporting information for funders, working with the project manager to help advocate and communicate the project to a wide range of stakeholders, and supporting the Project Manager to deliver this exciting project.

Collaboration with other professionals from across all disciplines from within our consultancy team, and externally (our appointed Design Team), is essential to provide seamless delivery within planned timescales. By working closely with the property team, you'll also ensure the impact on our operations is positive. You’ll be working with a diverse range of stakeholders in the Trust and also external agencies, contractors and funders and will ensure that everyone involved is informed, on track and up to date with each projects progress. This may also include acting as point of contact for the property team and representing the National Trust in meetings and media to emphasise the benefits of the project within the local area.
Could you do it? We are looking for not just a passion for delivering an exciting project within the National Trust but expertise and experience. We need someone with very strong communication skills who is proactive and a problem solver. If this sounds like the role for you, then we’d be delighted to hear from you.
Who we're looking for
We are looking for someone who demonstrates:

A calm, confident and amenable approach to working in an often changing environment
An understanding of working within a heritage or conservation environment
Strong communication skills, including the ability to create project updates for staff and volunteers and formal project reporting for both internal and external stakeholders
Strong and confident approach to working with project finances – updating finance tracking systems and working within the finance system to ensure that project finances are up to date
Experience of working in a multi-disciplinary project team
The ability to engage well with operational and project teams
Attention to detail and an eye for quality
The ability to work at pace and with energy within a dynamic setting
A creative approach, with the ability to drive improvement and change
Sound understanding of how projects evolve from broad thinking and scoping to shaping and detailed planning as well as successful project management in a multi-disciplined environment
The ability to work and effectively manage your time across a multi-disciplinary project
The package
Looking after you

Health cash plan – from as little as £2.81 per month for you and your dependents
Pension contribution match up to 10%
EAP and proactive Health and Wellbeing
Discounted gym membership
Looking after your career

About Fidelity Worldwide Investment

Fidelity Worldwide Investment is an asset manager serving investors in all corners of the world outside North America. It was established in 1969 and manages all significant asset classes for institutional and retail investors in long-term savings products. Fidelity and its subsidiaries employ over 6,500+ people in 23 countries managing US$ 350+ billion worldwide (as at Q3, 2014).

Fidelity’s investment style relies on fundamental research of companies and a strict bottom-up portfolio construction discipline. This means Fidelity’s analysts and portfolio managers look closely at a company’s balance sheet and future plans; meet regularly with and question its management; and then speak to its competitors, suppliers, customers and anyone else who might give them information that helps to assess whether the investment is a good one. Every investment in every portfolio is selected on its merit and ability to contribute to a better return.

The same can be said of its employees, who are encouraged to take intelligent risk in order to make small improvements that cumulatively improve the business. Fidelity is independent, not a subsidiary of a big bank or other institution, and is privately owned. This means that it can take long-term investment decisions rather than chase the next quarterly results as a listed company might. Fidelity believes its independence is a considerable advantage that benefits its customers.  

As well as investment management, Fidelity distributes the funds of other managers through its FundsNetworkTM platform, administers pension schemes, and has interests in various other enterprises in Europe and Asia. For further information please visit www.fidelityrecruitment.com.

The high availability and performance of the enterprise landscapes is ensured by the job holder



Problems/ Key Features
• Rapid rate of technology obsolescence makes this job complex.
• Demanding and increasing user service levels.
• To be ready 24 hours to handle any escalation from across the globe.
• Projects of Global dimension like “Consolidation of Email setups across 50+ locations“ need extensive planning. Further, these need huge coordination effort with internal and external teams and partners. Such projects take very long to get completed. 
• Accurate capacity planning for different enterprise landscapes becomes difficult in absence of right level of business parameters and rollout plans for the enterprise applications from the functional teams. 
• Lack of dynamic availability of bandwidth on the wide area network links from the service providers makes the balance between network performance and cost difficult. 
• Due to budget constraints, it becomes unviable to establish Disaster Recovery setup for critical enterprise scientific applications. 
• Virtualization of Server landscapes across different Scientific regulated applications get limited because of their non-certification and support thereof on the virtualized platforms. This leads to an in- optimal balance between the cost and utilization of Server infrastructure for the enterprise scientific applications. 
• Single vendor strategy for different areas of infrastructure provides good consolidation and service levels but goes higher on cost.
• It becomes difficult to obtain a good balance between the approved budget and the technology refresh cycles. 
• Selection of a good enterprise class solution for Infrastructure needs comprehensive and time consuming internal benchmarks to test and compare features of different solutions and then to align the shortlisted solutions on the Gartner Research before selecting the right solution for the organization.

About Fidelity Worldwide Investments

Fidelity Worldwide Investment is an asset manager serving investors in all corners of the world outside North America. It was established in 1969 and manages all significant asset classes for institutional and retail investors in long-term savings products. Fidelity and its subsidiaries employ over 5,400 people in 23 countries managing US$301 billion worldwide.

Fidelity’s investment style relies on fundamental research of companies and a strict bottom-up portfolio construction discipline. This means Fidelity’s analysts and portfolio managers look closely at a company’s balance sheet and future plans; meet regularly with and question its management; and then speak to its competitors, suppliers, customers and anyone else who might give them information that helps to assess whether the investment is a good one. Every investment in every portfolio is selected on its merit and ability to contribute to a better return.

The same can be said of its employees, who are encouraged to take intelligent risk in order to make small improvements that cumulatively improve the business. Fidelity is independent, not a subsidiary of a big bank or other institution, and is privately owned. This means that it can take long-term investment decisions rather than chase the next quarterly results as a listed company might. Fidelity believes its independence is a considerable advantage that benefits its customers.

As well as investment management, Fidelity distributes the funds of other managers through its FundsNetworkTM platform, administers pension schemes, and has interests in various other enterprises in Europe and Asia. For further information please visit www.fidelityrecruitment.com

Brief about Fidelity Worldwide Investments  Fidelity Worldwide Investment is an asset manager serving investors in all corners of the world outside North America. It was established in 1969 and manages all significant asset classes for institutional and retail investors in long-term savings products. Fidelity and its subsidiaries employ over 5,400 people in 23 countries managing US$301 billion worldwide. 

Fidelity’s investment style relies on fundamental research of companies and a strict bottom-up portfolio construction discipline. This means Fidelity’s analysts and portfolio managers look closely at a company’s balance sheet and future plans; meet regularly with and question its management; and then speak to its competitors, suppliers, customers and anyone else who might give them information that helps to assess whether the investment is a good one. Every investment in every portfolio is selected on its merit and ability to contribute to a better return.
The same can be said of its employees, who are encouraged to take intelligent risk in order to make small improvements that cumulatively improve the business. Fidelity is independent, not a subsidiary of a big bank or other institution, and is privately owned. This means that it can take long-term investment decisions rather than chase the next quarterly results as a listed company might. Fidelity believes its independence is a considerable advantage that benefits its customers.  
As well as investment management, Fidelity distributes the funds of other managers through its FundsNetworkTM platform, administers pension schemes, and has interests in various other enterprises in Europe and Asia. For further information please visit www.fidelityrecruitment.com

We’re one of the largest financial services providers in the world, and are also engaged in retail banking, credit cards, corporate banking, and wealth and investment management.

Main Function
Risk, Control & Regulatory Management (RCRM) supports Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, and Wealth & Investment Management (CIBWIM) Operations by providing central and independent support and coordination of the Operational Risk Management Framework.

The IB Control Testing team is a global team that sits within RCRM and is responsible for performing risk and control testing across IB Operations globally.  The team’s primary objective is to perform independent Conformance Testing of operational risk related controls to ensure they are designed and operating effectively in accordance with standards and policies.  The team is also responsible for performing other forms of Control Testing, i.e. scenario analysis, spot testing, thematic reviews, etc. when called upon to do so.
The control testing regional lead will report in to the global head of control testing and will be directly responsible for management the performance and development of the regional team of control testers. The candidate must therefore be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of testing methodologies and techniques along with extensive experience across IB Products and Operational processes and controls.  They must also display excellent interpersonal skills and demonstrate a proven ability to develop and manage large regional teams.  IB Operations is a global function so the candidate should also expect a degree of travel, both in region and occasionally outside

Main Duties
The primary purpose of the role is to manage and develop the regional conformance testing coverage and to determine the design and operating effectiveness of key controls being performed within APAC.  
• Establish a regional Control Testing team within Chennai and Mumbai including the  hiring and training, process and tools roll-out etc.
• The VP will be managing a team of approximately 5 to 6 staff. 
• The VP will be liaising across the Group, ensuring that Conformance Testing carried out in Chennai is consistent with Conformance Testing carried out in the other regions.  Also they will need to understand Group policies as they will be testing against these policies and opining on compliance to these policies.
• Work with the global testing lead, Ops Risk and Control Officers and Operations Management team to agree the scope of each testing schedule and ensure it aligns with the Testing Team capacity and Business priorities
• Work with the Risk and Control managers to understand the risks and controls to be tested, and the policies and standards to test against
• Lead the Control Testing team through each cycle of testing including:
• Process and Control Walkthroughs
• Design Effectiveness Test (DET) scripts and expected results
• Operational Effectiveness Test (OET) scripts and expected results
• Analyse IB Ops processes e.g. Manual Payments, to identify the Key Controls e.g. Call Back procedures
• Complex analysis of the current processes within various IB Operations teams within Chennai is required.  This will involve review of the process documentation produced by the team and critically assessing its adequacy, ensuring the correct key controls have been identified and tested at both a DET and OET level.  Ensure results from testing are communicated effectively to Process Owners, RCOs and the London Testing Team.  The VP test team lead would be expected to identify control gaps and solutions for closing these gaps. Often Process Owners and RCOs have asked the Conformance Testing Team for their opinion on remediation plans and to rubber stamp that they will actually address control issues. Therefore it is important for the VP to come up with innovative, creative, visionary, forward thinking solutions and assess solutions proposed by the Process Owner/RCO.   
• Work with Process Owners and RCO Leads to agree ineffective points and associated actions, owners and delivery dates.  There will be negotiating and influencing here to ensure the Process Owners and RCOs understand why they have been rated ineffective if they have been.  These conversations/communications can sometimes be difficult so getting this message across tactfully and diplomatically is a core skill that the VP should possess.
• Manage relationships with key Business Partners e.g. SOX, Audit ORM etc. and also Operations Management to ensure awareness of the Conformance Testing mandate as well as synchronising annual schedules and establishing efficiencies
• Present results to Ops management to provide assurance over the operation of key controls, or to identify areas for improvement e.g. ensure documented Limits of Authority.  Presentation skills are therefore crucial here. 
• Manage the tracking and timely implementation of the annual testing cycle along with all identified  remediation points
• Record and analyse results in order to identify themes in conjunction with the regional RCO and Operations management teams
• Share best practice Control Testing across the wider IB Organisation within the Region
• Facilitate deep dives into areas where significant control issues are identified
• Work with the Control Testing leads to enhance and develop the Control Testing methodology and ensure alignment with the longer term RCRM RMF objectives e.g. linking Control Testing objectives with the roll out of updated Control Standards.  The VP will therefore be able to have input and influence the strategy for Conformance Testing globally.

ROLE PROFILE GUIDANCE NOTES

The Requirement for a Role Profile
Every individual employed by Barclays must have a role profile, which describes clearly the purpose of the job they are employed to do, the key responsibilities of the role, and skills and knowledge required to do the job. All individuals must have a role profile completed on the standard template.

Background
On 1st December 2001, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) took responsibility for the regulation of firms undertaking activities covered by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.  Under the rules issued by the FSA, Barclays, as an authorised firm, is required to ensure, and evidence, that all our people are competent to perform their role.

Barclay’s employees fall into two separate categories. These categories are defined as follows:

• Approved Persons (for recruitment purposes this includes all approved persons in Groups 1 - 27, including all people in ‘significant influence’ roles in Groups 1-20).
• Associated Persons (for recruitment purposes this includes all of our other employees).

Barclays is required to verify and attest that all its employees possess the requisite level of experience, qualification, skill and competency to perform their role.  In addition, individuals occupying ‘Approved’ on ‘Controlled Function’ roles must be signed off by the FSA, through a registration process that is managed by the Regulated Registrations Team.

The role profile is a critical piece of evidence to meet these requirements.

In addition to a description of the key job purpose, main accountabilities and dimensions of the role, all role profiles must contain clearly articulated requirements for qualifications, experience, skills and competencies that can be measured and tested at interview.   

When writing a profile for an ‘Approved’ role, please bear in mind that a higher level of scrutiny of the candidate’s qualifications, experience, skills and competencies is required and that we may be called upon by the FSA to justify our hiring decision. Where the role and therefore the person undertaking the role requires approval by the FSA, this should be clearly recorded at the bottom of page 1.   If you are unsure whether the role is Approved or not, please contact your HR Business Partner or your Compliance team for guidance.  You can access further guidelines and a list of Controlled Function roles 1-20 by accessing the Compliance intranet at the following link:-  http://compliance.intranet.barclays.co.uk/

The Role Profile Format
It is a requirement that all role profiles are developed using the standard Barclays role profile template. 
This must not be altered.

Keeping the Role Profile Up to Date
It is the responsibility of the jobholder, with the support of their line manager, to ensure that their role profile is kept up to date, and reviewed at least annually.

Responsibility of Line Managers
It is the responsibility of the line manager to ensure that all members of staff in their team have an up to date role profile.

Role Profile in Key HR Processes
The role profile is a critical element of many HR processes, of which the critical ones are listed below, with the appropriate links:

Job Evaluation
The standard role profile template must be completed in order to support the development of any new organisation design and for the completion of job evaluation.

Managing Change
The completion of role profiles using the standard template is a mandatory requirement of managing the change process, and will be required therefore whenever changes to structures and potential redundancy situations arise.

Recruitment
The completion of a role profile using the standard role profile template is a critical precursor to any recruitment process commencing. 


BARCLAYS ROLE PROFILE – COMPLETION GUIDE

Scope: This role profile format applies to roles at al levels in Barclays

Job Title:  The title should reflect activities undertaken. If the job/position is on the UK SAP HR system, insert the job title as it appears on SAP (which can be viewed online in the UK at the HR Intranet site using Organisational Structure Charts), having updated the title on SAP as necessary.

Job Grade:  Insert the grade of the job e.g. B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, Senior Executive (SX) or IT grades. If the job has not been evaluated in terms of a job grade, seek guidance from HR.

Business Area (e.g. Cluster and SBU):  Start with the business area reporting direct to Group CEO e.g. the Cluster or Central Support Function. Then add any key intermediate departments between the Cluster/Function and role.

Name of Current Job Holder (if vacant leave blank; if interim say so):  If the role is open, leave this blank. If the role is filled on an interim basis, put the person’s name and add “(Interim)”.

Reports To (line manager’s job title only):  It is suggested that the manager’s name is excluded.

Number of Direct Reports (the minimum requirement, but direct report job titles can also be listed here):  Specify the number of hard line (i.e. not dotted line) direct reports excluding any personal/executive assistants. In addition to this minimum requirement, it is strongly recommended that the job titles of these direct reports are listed in the role profile. If they are not listed here, it is strongly recommended that they are captured in a supporting organisation chart, with a copy of the chart electronically pasted into the role profile document after the “agreed by” signature boxes, or saved/filed along side the role profile.

SAP Position ID Number (If role/position on the UK SAP HR system):  If the role is not on the UK SAP HR system put “not applicable”. If the role is to be added to SAP, source this number from HR as per HR intranet site instructions re recruitment. 

SAP Organisation Unit Number: Insert the organisation unit number (starting ‘61….’) which applies to the department/function.  This can be found from Barclays Organisational Structure Charts.


Controlled Function AND For Which Company Registered (if role requires FSA Approved Persons registration):  The FSA requires that persons carrying out one or more of a number of ""Controlled Functions"" must be approved by the FSA before they assume those responsibilities. When a new role is being contemplated, or a change to an existing Approved Persons Role is being considered, guidance should be sought from the relevant Compliance team to assess whether the resulting role should be described as Approved and, if so, under which Controlled Function(s) [the FSA currently specifies 27] and for which legal entity(s) [Barclays Bank PLC etc]. If the role does not require Approved Persons registration, put “not applicable”.

Overall Job Purpose:  It is extremely useful to have a brief statement of the overall purpose of the job. When drafting a role profile, this can be written at an early stage, but might better be left until the main body of the job description (Key Accountabilities) has been discussed and drafted. This will help the overall summary to be short and meaningful.

Key Accountabilities and approximate time split:  Ideally 4 to 10 points. Although optional, it is useful to indicate the approximate percentage of time that each key accountability is likely to consume. If extra detail is required by the line manager, sub-points can also be set out beneath 4 to 10 headings. The wording should distinguish between those activities which are to be carried out by the job holder and those which she/he has to “ensure” that others carry out. As Personal Development Plans record objectives relating to a given calendar year, it is best for the role profile to specify any longer term objectives and summarise key shorter term tasks (i.e. those that repeat once, or a number of times, a year). Wherever possible, it is suggested that accountabilities be quantified e.g. a broad indication be given of any cost/income/profit budget, the number of subordinates (not just direct reports), and the likely number of years (or months or weeks etc) set by the line manager for the completion and full review of the role holder’s longest task. This section could also be used to note key external relationships with customers and/or other stakeholders, and key internal horizontal relationships with colleagues (peer roles that the job holder must collaborate with i.e. excluding the role’s line manager and direct reports). 

Person Specification:  Highlight the personal attributes essential to performing the role: e.g. skills, competencies, expertise, knowledge, experience. Try to list no more than 10 to 15 points.  Focus on the depth and breadth of knowledge and expertise required, but experience must not be time-bound (i.e. must not be expressed in the form of years).

Date of Completion of Role Profile (month and year):  Month document typed (not signed).

Name of Role Profile Content Creator (person with this version electronically):  The person physically typing the content into the template document should insert their name here (even if they are not the role holder or line manger or HR business partner). If the role profile is subsequently revised by someone else (even slightly, other than being signed at the bottom), the content creator’s name should be revised as well (and Date of Completion, if necessary). 

Agreed by Job Holder / Line Manager / HR Business Partner:  Unless the role is vacant, a role profile is drafted ideally by the job holder and finalised by the line manager. HR advice may be sought during this process, if necessary. Once agreed by the line manager, the role profile should be sent to the HRBP for co-signing. The role profile and any supporting organisation chart will need to be kept on file in accordance with local arrangements. If the role is a very senior role (i.e. reports directly to an ExCo Board Member), the role profile and any supporting chart should be sent electronically to the Barclays HR Director’s office, within 1 month of any update to the role profile.

Evaluation : The following process should be facilitated through the relevant HR Business Partner:

B1 – B7 roles:  Evaluation takes place through the Job Evaluation Team in Poole. As long as the role profile is sufficiently detailed, then it is not necessary to complete an Extension for Evaluation purposes in order to obtain confirmation of level. 

SX roles: These need to go to Reward who will put the roles through a separate evaluation process to confirm that the roles are substantial enough to warrant the SX status.

Major Challenges (The challenges inherent in the role that require a continual test of the role holder’s abilities)

Risk analytics is highly technical and fast-developing owing to the regulatory pressure of Basel 2, 2.5 and 3 and the level of competition in financial markets, which demands ever more accurate and reliable measures of risk.  The current market conditions, in particular, imply significant changes with regard to the understanding of the risk factors underlying different portfolios.  The jobholder must maintain a good understanding and be capable of adopting new approaches and be able to explain them to non-technical counterparts.  The jobholder needs to demonstrate an expertise in highly technical areas (e.g. statistical analysis, stochastic calculus) as well as deep understanding of credit business and global market products. Good understanding of market risk and traded credit risk would be an advantage. Many Global wholesale portfolios are low default portfolios for which default/loss data are scarce. This requires the jobholder to be able to propose unconventional solutions that help to overcome these natural limitations. Owing to the global scarcity of analytics resources, the jobholder will be subject to the ongoing pressure of deadlines for project completion.

The role has global reach through the scope of risk models provided to the business.  The jobholder is required to work in an environment of significant ambiguity with autonomy, dealing with major issues for which there is no clear solution whilst still being able to provide judgment and clear direction. The jobholder is expected to demonstrate a high level of technical and managerial expertise.
Observance of Internal Controls (Compliance Policy / FIM requirements)
• Maintains HSBC internal control standards, including timely implementation of internal and external audit points together with any issues raised by external regulators.
